# Image_Recognization
The Fruit vs Flower Image Classification project uses TensorFlow/Keras and CNNs to classify images into fruits or flowers. Images are preprocessed, labeled, and trained on a deep learning model with convolution, pooling, and dense layers. The trained model is saved for future predictions.
